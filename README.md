# ðŸ§  Data Science Job Postings Analysis (2023)

This repository documents my learning journey in data analysis using Python. It is structured into three parts â€” Basic, Advanced, and Project â€” with the goal of building strong data wrangling and visualization skills.

## Objectives

- Learn how to clean, manipulate, and analyze data using Python.
- Get hands-on experience with essential libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.
- Understand the fundamentals of working with real-world datasets.


## Repository Structure

1. ðŸ“˜ `Basic`  
   - Introduction to data loading, inspection, and basic statistics.
   - First steps with Pandas and NumPy.

2. ðŸ“— `Advanced`  
   - Deeper dive into data cleaning, handling missing values, and grouping.
   - Exploratory data analysis using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

3. ðŸ“• `Project`  
   - Final analysis of 2023 data science job postings using the skills learned.
